Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Snake 3D Alpha
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document defines the requirements for the alpha version of Snake 3D, a 3D rendition of the classic Snake game built using Three.js. The alpha version aims to deliver a functional prototype with essential gameplay features and a simple user interface.

1.2 Scope
The alpha version of Snake 3D will include:

A single predefined level with a basic layout.
Core snake movement and growth mechanics.
Food items and a special item to unlock an exit door.
Collision detection with walls and the snake’s body.
A minimal user interface showing the score and level number.
Basic game over and restart functionality.
1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
Three.js: A JavaScript library for creating and rendering 3D graphics in web browsers.
2.5D: A visual style combining 2D gameplay mechanics with 3D graphical elements.
HUD: Heads-Up Display, an overlay showing game information like score and level.
2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
Snake 3D is a standalone, client-side web application that operates entirely within a web browser, requiring no server-side components for the alpha version.

2.2 Product Functions
Players control a snake using keyboard inputs.
The snake moves continuously on a grid-based plane.
Eating food increases the snake’s length and score.
After reaching a specific length, a special item appears to unlock the exit door.
Entering the unlocked exit door completes the level.
Colliding with walls or the snake’s own body triggers a game over state.
2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
Casual Gamers: Players familiar with arcade-style games, expecting simple controls and engaging mechanics.
2.4 Operating Environment
Web Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge (latest versions).
Hardware: Devices with WebGL support and a keyboard.
2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
The game must utilize Three.js for 3D rendering.
Movement must be grid-based for simplicity and consistency.
2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
Users understand basic Snake game mechanics (e.g., avoiding self-collision).
The game assumes a keyboard is available for input.
3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Gameplay Mechanics
3.1.1 Snake Movement
The snake shall move continuously in the direction of the last keyboard input.
Arrow keys or WASD shall control the snake’s direction.
Movement shall occur one grid cell at a time.
3.1.2 Growth and Food
Food items shall spawn at random empty grid cells within the level.
When the snake’s head intersects with a food item, the snake shall grow by one segment.
After consuming food, a new food item shall appear at a random empty grid cell.
3.1.3 Special Item and Door Unlocking
When the snake reaches a length of 5 segments, a special item shall appear at a random empty grid cell.
Consuming the special item shall unlock the exit door, indicated by a visual change (e.g., color or animation).
3.1.4 Level Completion
When the snake’s head intersects with an unlocked exit door, the level shall end.
A "Level Complete" message shall display, with an option to restart the game.
3.1.5 Collision Detection
The game shall detect collisions between the snake’s head and walls or its own body.
A collision shall end the game, displaying a "Game Over" message.

Clicking "Start Game" shall load the first level.
3.2.3 Game Over Screen
Upon game over, a screen shall show the final score and a "Restart" button.
Clicking "Restart" shall reset the game to its initial state.
3.3 Visual and Audio Design
3.3.1 Visuals
The game shall use 3D models for the snake, food, special item, walls, and exit door.
A top-down 2.5D camera view shall be implemented, positioned above the grid.
Basic lighting and shadows shall enhance the 3D effect.
3.3.2 Audio
Background music shall play during gameplay.
Sound effects shall accompany eating food, consuming the special item, and game over events.
4. Non-Functional Requirements
4.1 Performance
The game shall maintain a minimum of 30 FPS on average hardware.

4.4 Scalability
The game’s architecture shall support adding new levels in future versions.
5. System Features
5.1 Grid System
A grid system shall govern movement and collision detection.
Each grid cell shall map to a specific position in the 3D environment.
5.2 Camera System
The camera shall track the snake’s head, keeping it centered on the screen.
The camera shall maintain a fixed height and angle for a consistent 2.5D view.
5.3 Level Design
The alpha shall feature one predefined level (e.g., a square room with walls and an exit door).
The level shall include at least one food item and one special item.
6. Other Requirements
6.1 Security
